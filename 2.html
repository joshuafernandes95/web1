  <h2>CSS</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
  describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
  such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
   alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation
   of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
   separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
   control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple
   web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
.css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

<h1>hello</h1>
<p> This is something crazy. I love it.</p>
What is br in html? It is to specify line breaks.Just like this.<br><br>Did you understand?
Do you wonder why I used br twice? Thats because I wanted a empty line in between two paragraphs.
