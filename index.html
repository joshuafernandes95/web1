  <h2>WEB</h2>
<p>Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E.
  Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate
  programming": the idea that one could create software as works
  of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text,
  rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming
  languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human
  readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.[1]Web consists
  of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable
Pascal code from the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted,
 printable documentation using TeX.</p>

<h1>hello</h1>
<p> This is something crazy. I love it.</p>
What is br in html? It is to specify line breaks.Just like this.<br><br>Did you understand?
Do you wonder why I used br twice? Thats because I wanted a empty line in between two paragraphs.
