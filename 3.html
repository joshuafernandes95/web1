  <h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming
  language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
  HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
  web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major
   web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the
   user's device.</p>

<p> This is something crazy. I love it.</p>
What is br in html? It is to specify line breaks.Just like this.<br><br>Did you understand?
Do you wonder why I used br twice? Thats because I wanted a empty line in between two paragraphs.
